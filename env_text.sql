Play will start at 11am (1000 GMT), 15 minutes later than last summer and a reversion to the old timings.  Lord''s is bathed in lovely spring sunshine and conditions are just perfect for cricket.Now for he big news, England captain Andrew Flintoff has won the toss and elected to bat first. England eleven - Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Liam Plunkett, Sajid Mahmood, Matthew Hoggard, Monty Panesar.\nSri Lanka eleven - Upul Tharanga, Jehan Mubarak, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Tilakaratne Dilshan, Chamara Kapugedera, Farvez Maharoof, Chaminda Vaas, Nuwan Kulasekara, Muttiah Muralitharan.'),

(1803, 1, 'Hello and Welcome to Cricinfo''s ongoing live coverage of the 2006 Sri Lanka tour of England.After a hard fought test match at Lord''s, the teams have now moved to Edgbaston in Birmingham.Leading upto the test match, the Weather God hasn''t been too kind on the groundstaff and the players. There have been constant showers around Birmingham leading up to today, and as the cricinfo preview by Andrew Miller pointed out, the start of the game could be delayed until lunch on the first day.After disappointing in their tour games, Sri Lanka rose wonderfully well to the occasion and drew the test at Lord''s - also thank the row of dropped catches by the English fielders.The positives to come out of that test, as far as Sri Lanka are concerned, would be the form of their captain - Mahela Jayawardene played brilliantly for his hundred, by virtue of which he now has his name on the Roll of Honours in the Lord''s dressing room. He received ample support from most of his team-mates in the second innings, Jayawardene apart, six other batsmen went past the 50-run mark - only the third time in test history that 7 batsmen have gone past 50 in an innings.England on the other hand, will not have too many worries - fielding and catching apart. They put down as many 9 catches in the Lord''s test, and will be wanting to improve on that - it was a case of a comfortable victory being denied because of dropped catches.There has been some controversy about the pitch on which this test will be played. The strip which was generally being used for test matches has been rendered inapprorpriate for test match cricket, and therefore this test will be played on a brand new strip - a virgin strip altogether.We are awaiting more information about whether the test match will start on-time or if there will be any delay.Stay tuned for more information.Some team news just tricking in, England have showed faith in the team that played the Lord''s test - they have decided to go with the same team, and that means, there''s still no chance for Jon Lewis.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to bat. Sri Lanka have made two changes to their team.  Vandort and Malinga come in place of Mubarak and Kapugedera.The good news is that play will start on time. The forecast for today looks good.That''s it from me now, Arun Gopalakrishnan, I now hand it over to Binoy George who will take you through this test match.Players are out in the middle, it will be Vandort and Tharanga to open the innings.

This is Binoy George, and along with Jamie Alter, we will take you through today''s proceedings.The last 8 tests played here have produced results. It was 1970/71, when India last won a test series in West Indies(1-0). Can they do it here, that''s the big question. A lot is expected of this Indian team, can they pull it off?The curator of the Sabina Park has dished out a pitch that will be to the faster bowlers'' liking. Will India go in with four fast bowlers? It is unlikely though.It is now over to Arun for some tidbits.Thank You Binoy. We''re at the Sabina Park, and it would be just apt to start off with a fact about the Sabina Park. Here it goes ...Its back to Binoy now for some news on teams and the toss.Thanks Arun. Just a word or two about the important 22-yards - the pitch looks brown in color and has a sprinkling of grass. Both captains think this isn''t the kind of wicket one would tend to associate with Sabina Park - they think it will be slow, there will be tennis-ball kind of bounce, and will deteriorate as the test match progresses. The team winning the toss, will surely like to bat first.Indian captain called correctly and chose to bat first. India go in with the same team, with the two fast bowlers and two spinners. West Indies also remain unchanged.We''re just minutes away from live action .. stay tuned!It will be Pedro Collins bowling to Jaffer.'),
(1808, 2, 'West Indies hold the upper hand in the 4th and Final Test at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica. The West Indian bowlers put the pressure on the Indian batsmen and picked up the wickets regularly, they played poorly to end up on 200. They would have been dismissed more cheaply had not Dravid and Kumble played their part. Dravid was brilliant with his batting, he played patiently for his 81, Kumble supported him well with his 45. For West Indies the bowlers bowled well, varrying their length. Jerome Taylor took his first 5-wicket haul.The Pitch also played its part, there was extra bounce, some of the balls kept low. The batting was tough. What will day 2 hold? I am Binoy George along with Jamie Alter Welcomes you to Cricinfo''s live coverage on day 2. We will take you through today''s proceedings.The pitch on day 2 looks dry, not much of change in the track. It is expected that the batsmen will have a good time. How will the West Indies fare with their batting?  The weather looks fine and good. Please stay tuned.

(1812, 1, 'Hello and welcome to Cricinfos live coverage of the second and final Test between Sri Lanka and South Africa.Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara batted themselves into the record books at Colombo. Their record partnership set the platform and Muttiah Muralitharans relentless spell took Sri Lanka to a commanding win in the first Test. The lead is unassailable but its not over yet for South Africa. They did put up an inspired fightback in the second innings and at the end of the day it was their first-innings debacle that cost them the Test. It is a must win situation for South Africa and it will be interesting to see how they approach the second Test. A series-levelling win is the best they can accomplish now but given the stunning form the Sri Lankans are in the odds are against them.Return of the giants - Chaminda Vaas, who missed the first Test with a hamstring injury is back in the playing eleven in place of Dilhara Fernando and Shaun Pollock who opted out of the first Test because of the birth of his second daughter replaces Andre Nel. However, South Africa are still without their captain Graham Smith and allrounder Jaques Kallis. Hopefully Pollocks return will lend some much needed experience to the battered South African line-up.Ashwell Prince has won the toss and elected to bat first. P Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo is bathed in sunshine and we are all set for the start of day one.Mahela Jayawardene has said he expects South Africa to come back hard at them in the second Test - I am quite positive that the second Test is not going to be as easy as the first one but if we do the hard work and have the commitment that we have being showing out there we can get the result our way, South Africa will be a different team with the return of Shaun Pollock. Their combination will be different. Shaun is a seasoned campaigner and we know what to expect from him. He will definitely strengthen their batting in the middle order.Ashwell Prince, South Africas stand-in captain, was confident that his batsmen were coming to terms playing Murali. In the first innings he applied a lot of pressure on our batsmen who tried to take liberties with the other bowlers and lost their wicket, said Prince. But in the second innings we played him better and better. Although he took six wickets he had to bowl 60-odd overs. We are quite confident of taking him on. I hope the pitch breaks up more in the last couple of days of the Test to give our bowlers a better opportunity to win the match. Not only [Nicky] Boje but our quicks will also be able to make use of the wear and tear of it.  Click here for more.My name is Sajan Nair, and I will be your commentator for the day.It will be Herschelle Gibbs and Andrew Hall to open the innings for South Africa. For the record - Gibbs, who averaged 26.5 in his last 14 Tests only managed 19 and 18 in the first Test and he is a man under pressure.'),

At last, were nearly there and the Gabba - or Gabattoir as some call it and, judging by the cacophonous noise out there, its damn close to a fortress-like atmosphere - is slowly filling up. Ricky Ponting had no hesitation in choosing to bat and both teams have gone with the tried and tested. The pitch is dry and, although theres a hint of grass, the cracks are visible and it could turn a country mile come the fourth day.The national anthems are over - Adam Gilchrist was thankfully the only one to do The American Thing and hold his baggy green next to his heart.

Good morning, Will ...10.50am Ian Botham and Ian Healy are carrying out the two flags and we are about to have the national anthems. The two teams are coming out as well and the noise inside the Gabba has been upped a few decibels.

The surface is dry and there are cracks on it, and the consensus is that the pitch will play well for a couple of days before the cracks open up, and thereafter there will be uneven bounce for the quick men ... not to mention what Warne will do.10.35am Australia have won the toss and will bat A huge cheer goes up from the home crowd but a shocker from Sky TV. Nicholas is interviewing Flintoff and the on-field analysts are yakking over the top of him. Shambles.  Our man on the spot gives us the quotes nevertheless ...

Behind them, the pitch is beginning to clear in preparation for the toss which is in less than five minutes.  The stands are filling out nicely and the PA is getting really quite deliriously excited ...10.15am England have named their XI and as expected, Ashley Giles has been preferred to Monty Panesar. Its safety first from Fletcher, but with some reason, Andrew Miller tells us. Remember 2002-03, when Craig White was Englands No. 7. The idea of a tail that long is anathema to the coach. Giles acts as ballast, and should allow Englands top six to play with greater freedom.Feedback on the decision to play Giles coming in. Giles starting in place of Panesar? We all knew it was coming. What is going on? Fletcher you havent got a clue, writes Neil. Even if the long tail is a good point, and I rate Giles, has he really played enough cricket to be prepared for this match? asks Michael Wells.Sriram Veera, our insomniac in Bangalore, advises us that this is the 100th Test that Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath have played together.England team have been in a huddle on the practice strip and are now jogging round before going through their stretches.

Here we are in Perth for what, just three Tests in, could be the Ashes decider should Australia win. Following Shane Warnes spine-chilling spinnery last Test, England find themselves staring down the barrel and the bookies are all backing an Australian victory. This, in short, is massive, so thanks for tuning in and welcome along to Cricinfos coverage.Now, despite their erstwhile dominance, Australia have had to make one change to their XI after Damien Martyn jumped before he was pushed last week. With the side looking for an extra bowler, in strides the allrounder Andrew Symonds, who offers versatility with medium-pace and off-spin both in his armoury.And of course he is no slouch with the bat. In fact, hes the opposite of slouchy - all shoulders and intent - and hell bat at 6, with Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke bumping up to 4 and 5, respectively. Its just his 11th Test and his first in the Ashes.So they are without the retired Martyn ... and, what do you know, the commentary team for this Test is bereft of our very own Martin (Williamson) and his own special brand of effortless timing. Three become two, which means itll be Will Luke and myself  Jenny Thompson in the chair. Actually, chairs. So, Martyn fans get weeping ... but Martin fans hold on to your hankies - hell be back for Melbourne.Lets turn our attention now to the pitch. Traditionally the surface has favoured fast bowling but in recent times its been gripping and has lost some of its pace making it less a Perth flyer and more of a slow service. It was watered on Tuesday and left to bake yesterday and expectations are that it will start to turn early. We will, of course, keep you updated with the pitch state throughout the match - and bring you the England team as soon as we have it.In the meantime, you could drop us a line to tell us what you think?

Day four is looming large at Newlands and you are invited to join in on the ride. South Africa impressed in patches yesterday, there were a couple of good innings that stood out but in the end they fell short of the Indian total by 41 runs. One cant help but say that the Indian bowling and fielding were on the wrong lane at times and that helped South Africa to an extent in closing the gap.Its a new day and the Indian batsmen will have to start all over again. Their first objective, no doubt will be to see off the new ball. With the series in the balance, its up to India to produce the goods, they can either take the bull by the horn and play positive cricket from the beginning - but that may always backfire as a tactic - or play it safe and ensure that another overseas series loss does not get added to the list. South Africa will need an early breakthrough and keep the tempo and stop the game from slipping away. Pollock and Co will be on the hunt from the word go and its going to be a decisive day for both the teams.Once again its a beautiful day for cricket, the sun is shining, no could in sight, bit on the warm side but thats Newlands for you. As for the pitch, its still a good track to batting track, but the batsmen will have to contend with the ever disintegrating rough outside the right-handers leg stump.Here comes the Indian openers, and it will be Jaffer and SEHWAG to open the innings - so the point has been made, India want runs, and they want it quickly.

Shoaib Akhtar has flown home after tweaking a hamstring, while Herschelle Gibbs has had to sit this one out after the ICC upheld his ban.Also, and frankly somewhat controversially, Shaun Pollock and Andre Nel have both been rested.

The weather in Mirpur has become more humid than it was when India last visited for the first two one-dayers earlier this month. The pitch will demand hard work from the bowlers - it wears a dark look because of the black clay used here, which makes the surface hard. It is expected to be bouncier than the one at Chittagong, but the lack of grass means bowlers wont be queuing up for their chance to run in and let it fly.9.25 am This Test is Dav Whatmores last match in charge of Bangladesh.

How do all the guys feel about working with a woman who seems to be a better cricketer than they will ever be? Feel fine, thanks for asking.

You have no idea how long I have been waiting for this, he begins. Usually, this is followed with a torrent of abuse, but not today. Have I told you about the time I played against Sylvester Joseph? And lo, the monster is born. Old Cranleighans [his school] are the last - and possibly only - English side to have won at the Antigua Recreation Ground, he says.

Well have more team news as soon as we get it - but this is an interesting selection. Englands attack lacked control - basic accuracy - in the first Test, so Sidebottoms experience (and his control...it is hoped) must have been a persuading factor. Plus, of course, this is his old stomping ground. Nevertheless, he does own one of the best surnames in the world, and for that we should be very grateful. He and his father, Arnie, were both proud members of the One Test Wonder club, so Sidebottom senior will have to prop up that bar alone for now.

As, I must admit, did I. But his objection is not that he is a very average coach but that he was an average spinner and also that hes a foreigner. Which would suggest that the likes of John Buchanan, Dav Whatmore, Duncan Fletcher, Peter Moores, Micky Arthur, Tim Nielson, Troy Cooley etc should never be allowed to consider coaching.  Send your thoughts about the article.9.50am Mixed response from readers to Vaughan-Flintoff story. Some think Flintoff deserved a public slap, others than Vaughan was out of order ... a few even demanding he quit.  Send us your feedback.  If you want to listen to the audio of what Vaughan actually said, click here.Tony Booth emails that writing rather gloomy around Manchester is stating the obvious. No cheap jokes, please. Andrew McGlashan, who will be bulletining this Test, has strong links to the city and assures us it is just as sunny as the south east of England.8.30am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the third Test at Old Trafford. Its a fairly gloomy day, low cloud all round Manchester but the forecast is that it should stay dry today and tomorrow.Of considerable interest will be the reception given to Michael Vaughan after his alleged comments about Andrew Flintoffs antics during the World Cup.England named their side on Sunday, but West Indies will give Chris Gayle a late fitness test on his side strain.  They believe that the pitch might take spin and so Gayles inclusion is vital for the balance of the team.  We want him to be able to bowl in the nets for us if he is going to do it in the match. If he cant bowl, then we will have to make adjustments, David Moore, the coach, said. We would like to have some sort of spinning option, thats for sure. Hes the only one who has got Test credentials with regards to his spin bowling.'),

Michael Vaughan won and chose, without hesitation, to field. Its a bit humid, he said, well try to get the ball to swing a bit. The groundsman deserves credit. Well try to put the ball in the right areas and create some pressure. Matthew Hoggard comes back in for Liam Plunkett, as expected.Its a good toss to lose, says Daren Ganga, but hes relishing the chance to bat first and to bat well.The pitch is surprisingly firm, and has a lot of grass on it. A good toss for England to win, the conditions look good for swinging.Now that Mr (AR) Duckworth has spoken on who should be James Bond, says Murray in Canada, can Mr Lewis be far behind, followed by a complex formula no-one can understand to determine who really should be crickets Bond? Why not.1.25pm Monty Panesar has just dropped a catch during Englands warm-up exercises. Hope thats not an omen, says Andrew McG. Better get them out of the way, now, though - the reverse of what coaches used to say following a jaffa in nets, Save those for the match. Panesars fielding has been pretty good this series, as it was during the winter. All the same, hes still the crowds hero whenever he stops one. The toss is in five minutes time. Meanwhile, Sir Ian Botham walks out to the middle to a standing ovation, Allan Donald goes down on one knee to shake his hand.1.00pm The umpires are out again. Vaughan pointing at the wicket ends on the other pitches. Hes now talking with Daren Ganga, walking earnestly to the damp areas which are causing concerns, notes Andrew McGlashan. Vaughan is now shadow-batting. Both captains are now talking with the umpires.Play will start at 2pm. There will be 70 overs left today. The England players, in tracksuits and shorts, are on the field, practising with a rugby ball. Wrong sport, lads, but at least being on the pitch is some encouragement. The toss will be at 1.30pm.Ive always thought Mr. Ramprakash would be a great Heathcliffe, says A R Duckworth, presumably not meaning the cat. He would also do a good Bond... and Superman... I swear this really isnt written by me.When I was growing up in Guyana, says Adrian Moore, we used to say that the best way to break a drought was to announce a Test match. Maybe a similar phenomenon exists in England. How else to explain the rest of the rain, though?Lots of you are wanting Bond, Shane Bond. I shall pass on all of your suggestions to the filmmakers.12.25pmNews. An early lunch is being taken, at 12.30pm. The next inspection will be at 1pm, with a view to working out when they can start after that. Hello everyone, its the big splitting Jennifer here.Great idea, doing old BBB highlights, says Ask-Steven Lynch. Rhodes-Trumper FOUR! A capital shot through the covers by Mr Trumper. An absolutely splendid idea there by Mr Lynch. Super.If its any consolation, says Julian Deeprose. Its rodding it down here in Ireland. No, we are inconsolable, Im afraid.12.10pm...and theyre off. The umpires strike back to the pavilion, so expect an announcement in two shakes of a bees knee.Why not a few words en passant in praise of Sir Both!? demande Peter le Sheppard. Mais oui, mais oui. Splendid efforts, definitely deserved his knighthood. In fact dont just take my word for it, check out our beefed up coverage.The umpires have been out there for six minutes now which leads us to believe were unlikely to be watching much cricket in the foreseeable...Were being bombarded with emails telling us to come over to Australia, move to Dubai and other such nonsense. Were quite happy here, thanks. Well, Jennys not - shes splitting to Australia with her soon-to-be husband - but then shes very special.How about entertaining us with a ball by ball highlights of a previous match, like they do on the telly! says Jake Jackson. Believe me, were tempted.12.00pm\nDar is now rolling a ball along the turf, perhaps with an eye to a future past-time, to see how much water it picks up. If its too wet, well be waiting some more. Its all rather simple, and a little bit special too.11.55am\nWe have movement, in the form of umpires. Theyre marching out on the quagmire of Chester-le-Street. Wellies not yet spotted. Aleem Dar is checking the bowlers run-ups, running his hand across the grass. The tension is unbearable...well, sort of, dryly observes Gnasher. He tell us that the umpires are walking around what would be the inner circle of a one-dayer, and there seems to be some concern over the ends of the other pitches.Right. Theres nothing else for it. If anyones bored in London, and wouldnt mind winging their merry way to W12 with croissants and coffee, we would be eternally grateful. You might even get a gift from us. Go on. Help the needy.Mark says its hurling it down here in Newcastle; you could be next.Im sat at home waiting for an update on the state of play, Adam demands. Well, we cant offer you much until noon Im afraid, for that is when the umpires don their wellies and brave the quagmire.Paul Collingwood is using his local knowledge and checking how damp the square and outfield is, Gnasher informs us. Tell us thingsWow, exclaims the flat-capped Gnasher, the sun is threatening to make an appearance which gets us all excited for a fleeting moment before he adds, well...it was brief.The worryingly name Mike in Brittany spears the following email. When the odds of England losing the Test Match are 28/1 (with only two competitive bowlers and one opener who cant buy a run), you know that the opposition are in serious disarray.I hate to be a pedant, says Peter Jones (never the best way to start an email to us), but there is no such time as 12.00pm (when the pitch inspection is due).  As the Royal Observatory people say........ Oh dear. It really is going to be one of those days.2nd day10.15am Morning all. Will here. As the headline says, well be lucky to start on time. I hear there be clouds aflutterin but, so far, its dry according to Cricinfos resident northerner and eternal optimist, Andrew Gnasher McGlashan. More from him soon, and more shortly from me and my copilot for today, Jenny Thompson, who is currently winging her winning way across London. Hope youre all having a splendid Saturday.1st day12.30pm Thats your lot. Its all over. Futility reigns at Chester-le-Street, and play has been abandoned for the day. Move along now, nothing left to see here. Were off to listen to Bring your Daughter to the Slaughter on YouTube, so join Jenny Thompson and Will Luke at 11am tomorrow for what promises to be a slightly less dingy day. Thanks very much for your emails. Its been moist.12.20pm Pity poor Robert Wakefield, who doesnt know what to do with himself, having arranged his entire day around the Test match. Still, there are compensations ... Im emailing you from my PDA whilst sunbathing by the pool in 37 degrees centigrade, in Bahrain. Alright. On yer bike, poser.12.15pm No updates from Chester-le-Street at the moment, because Gnasher is face-down in a plate of scoff. But suffice to say it is damp, drizzly and minging. Time for a game of Slogout, surely.12.10pm The next inspection is scheduled for 12.30pm, but its all pretty hopeless, we reckon. Sit tight, and email us with your words of boredom.12.00pm Heres Cricinfos man on the spot. I never like to knock the north, but its pretty miserable at the moment, says Andrew McGlashan. I would tell you about the glorious countryside, but I cant see it. He can, however, see the crowd through the gloom, which has swelled to about 50. Great fun.11.55am The entire office has just leapt out their chairs in shock - were being treated to the highlights of Englands victory over West Indies at Bridgetown in 1993-94, and wed all forgotten just how excitable Charles Colvile could get ...11.50am Lenny from Durham University has got the hump on Harmys behalf. I think your mate Will should get the kit on and face Harmy at 90mph instead of taking cheap shots.I cant find his 200 Test wickets and 500 first-class wickets anywhere in the records. Quite so. Will?11.45am I have now run out of ways to depress you and describe rain, so for more meteorology and wit, heres Andrew Miller. Thanks Martin. Hello everyone. Well, isnt this a thrill?11.40am Andrew sends a soggy update. Rain sweeping across the ground, the chefs are attempting some sort of dance with their umbrellas. Its so wet there have to be doubts if they will get any play today.11.15am Not wishing to be a harbinger of gloom, but play has already been abandoned at Leeds, 90 odd miles to the south.  Heres the latest Met Office radar image things. The Riverside is right under the worst of it but it looks clearer to the south.Just an aside to point out that if there is play Andrew Miller will be offering his views on how batsmen should be playing etc. He batted yesterday in a game against clients, missing four balls and then scooping the fifth straight back to the bowler for a lovely duck ... bear that in mind.A Sea King helicopter has just flown over Lumley Castle...if there is much more rain it might need to come back and start airlifting people out of Chester-le-Street11.10am An email asking what cricketers get up to in dressing-rooms during long delays. Cards is a favourite, Harmison plays darts (Will Luke collapses in hysterics, mumbling about him hitting everything but the board - cheap shot), others sleep. Send in your ways of passing the hours.11.05am A few emails asking why we no longer run wicket alerts. Well, we do, all combined in a news-wickets thingy.  Download it here  and configure it to update you with wicket alerts for the team of your choice as well as the news headlines.10.45am Inspection at 12.30pm we are told. Given that its still raining, that could turn out to be a triumph of optimism over reality. A group of people on chefs hats have arrived in the temporary stand. They are unlikely to stay there too long ...10.35am Not a chance of any play soon, covers in place, rain falling and  only a smattering of spectators huddled under umbrellas show that there should be a Test starting today. The toss is delayed. While we scour the Thesaurus for alternatives for rain, send us your feedback on anything that you want to get off your chest.10.30am It gets grimmer as the rain falls and puddles form on the edge of the covers. Better news in London where Andrew Miller and Will Luke are grinning like five-year-old boys at Christmas as they take delivery of tickets for an Iron Maiden concert next weekend.Rob continues the great north-east name discussion. Theres also the delightfully named Quaking Houses near Stanley, and how could I forget Deaf Hill? Incidentally I used to live on Quality Street in a village outside of Durham City ...10.05am The SuperSopers are engaging in a Canute-like exercise in futility as the rain falls quicker and heavier than they can absorb the water off the covers.   The umpires appeared for a time, chatted with the groundsman, and then retreated to the pavilion.10.00am Sitting waiting for the cricket to start - weather is great here at Victoria Golf Club outside Kandy, emails Mike Varney. What happened to all the global warming?  It seems to have stopped at Leicester. Just to add, that golf club is one of the finest in the world ...amazing views and somewhere out there in the hills are at least 30 of my balls.The north east is wonderful for place names, says Neil Shaw. Just down the road is the wonderful Pity Me (supposedly a corruption of the French, Petite Mer [Small Sea, despite being inland]). Theres also No Place at nearby Beamish.9.50am Only a handful of people in the ground - 11 at the last count. Most locals appear to have taken a look out the window and opted for a lie in.  Check out Slogout, the new online cricket game from Cricinfo. Its the most action youre likely to get for some time.  Andrew Millers best is 367. Go for it ...9.40am A couple of England players stroll onto the outfield under an umbrella, squelch a bit and head back to dry land.  Other than that, not much happening.9.30am The covers are in place and the rain is unremitting. Youre  optimistic said one of the staff outside the ground as Cricinfos finest arrived. Passing shower said another, except its taken three days to pass.While we watch people drift in wishing that they hadnt come dressed as  Tarzan and wearing only a loincloth, send us your feedback on anything that you want to get off your chest.8.45am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the fourth and final Test from Chester-le-Street. Not good news, I am afraid,  as its been raining overnight and its still falling steadily.  The forecast doesnt offer much cause for cheer either, although it should get slowly better over the weekend. Whats more, its cold, causing Andrew McGlashan, our man on the spot, to moan that hes not brought enough sweaters.  He reckons that a prompt start is out of the question.'),

If this match has to go the distance, its entirely upto Bangladesh to save face and give the home side a fight. Its not often that Bangladesh get opportunities to play a series of three Tests or more and their encouraging World Cup performance must have played a big part in giving them an additional Test in this series.

Hobart [the second Test] is looking pretty realistic right now, but Ive got to get back to full fitness otherwise its too much of a risk.The two umpires have met with the match referee and the toss should take place in about ten minutes, says Jenny.  Its very dry, the covers came off about ten minutes ago. The outfield will be slow, and a bit damp, so that will play on the captains minds, whether to bat or bowl first.Australia havent played Test cricket now for some ten months, but you wont bet against them coming out hard. Its something of a new era for Australia, without Shane Warne, McGrath and Justin Langer. Phil Jaques has earned his spot alongside Matthew Hayden at the top, and its a special day for left-arm pacer Johnson, who makes his Test debut at home.

The last time they toured, in the winter of 2004, they lost in Darwin and drew in Cairns. In 18 Tests between these two sides, Sri Lanka have won just one match, at Kandy back in 1999. Since then, Australia have lost just two of 29 Test series.Much of the focus of this first Test will be on Muralitharans attempt to break Warnes world-record Test wicket tally.

Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar, the expected umpires for this Test, did not get their visas processed in time, so the ICC was forced to send an SOS to Rudi Koertzen and Tony Hill to make an emergency dash to Brisbane.'),

If the pitch does live upto its predictions, then Pollock would feel fortunate to sit out this one. South Africa have decided to go in with the same side which won in Pakistan, so fair enough.New Zealand have included Wellington fast bowler Iain OBrien to partner Chris Martin and Shane Bond with the new ball. OBrien played the last of his two Tests last year, against Australia.Our stats wizard, HR Gopalakrishna, has kindly provided us some milestones below. Read on....1. Jacques Kallis has an aggregate of 1010 runs against New Zealand and needs 91 more to overhaul DJ McGlews 1100 run aggregate and become South Africas top scorer against New Zealand. McGlew and Kallis remain the only two South African batsmen to aggregate 1000 plus runs against New Zealand2. Stephen Fleming has scored 918 runs against South Africa and needs 82 more to become the first New Zealander to get to 1000 runs against them.3. DJ McGlew and JH Kallis share the record for most hundreds by a South African batsman against New Zealand. One more hundred by JH Kallis would make him the South African batsman with most hundreds - four - against New Zealand4. DL Vettori has become the 26th Test captain for New Zealand.5. One more five wickets haul in an innings for M Ntini would be his fifth five wicket haul against New Zealand. If he gets there, he would become the first South African bowler to have five five wickets haul against New Zealand. It would be also a series record for bowlers from both sides. CS Martin is the lone the New Zealand bowler who have captured four five wickets hauls against South Africa.Hello and welcome to Cricinfos ball-by-ball coverage of the first Test between South Africa and New Zealand at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. This is Kanishkaa Balachandran, your commentator through this Test.New Zealand are coming out of a hibernation at the Test level, given that they played their last Test back in December 2006, against Sri Lanka. South Africa, on the other hand are fresh from a away-series victory against Pakistan so the home side will, predictably, begin as favourites.'),

He will replace Thilan Samaraweera. Lasith Malinga, the fast bowler with a slingy action, has replaced the experienced Chaminda Vaas.You can check out Peter Englishs preview here. Muttiah Muralitharan remains the focus. He needs seven more to break the world record and wouldnt it be a fitting tribute for him to cover himself in glory in Australia. The pitch, according to the statistics at least, has tended to favour spin.Our informers tell us that Kumar Sangakkara will keep wicket (taking on the extra burden) while Prasanna Jayawardene will play as a specialist batsman. More from our informers soon. They are a great lot.Incidentally Vaas has missed 19 Tests in his career. Not sure how many he was dropped for. In the meanwhile the national anthems are out of the way and Hayden walks in with his new partner (opening and not love, one assumes) Phil Jaques.

Thanks for tuning into Cricinfo again, and lets hope for a good Tests cricket.Im Jamie Alter, your commentator for this match.Word from the middle is that New Zealand have won the toss and they will bat.The visitors have handed Mark Gillespie his debut and Lou Vincent also comes in in the absence of Shane Bond (sent home with an abdominal problem) and Jacob Orams hamstring injury. South Africa named an unchanged line-up for the fourth Test in a row, again leaving out veteran Shaun Pollock.The pitch once again looks to be a focal point. South African coach Mickey Arthur said, on the eve of this Test, that it looks good but cracks are already appearing. Daniel Vettori, New Zealands captain, says it resembles the Wanderers. Taking a look at it, Id reckon it should last five days.After a massive 358-run victory at the Wanderers last Sunday, the hosts have already said theres no room for complacency over the next five days. Despite the efforts of Jacques Kallis and Hashim Amla - who added 330 for the third wicket at Johannesburg - the top orders lack of consistency remains a worry. Only three partnerships went beyond the 50-run mark in either of South Africas innings last week. The bowling, however, was at the top of its game, dismissing New Zealand for 118 and 172, led by Dale Steyns first ten-wicket match haul.New Zealands batting has been shaky all tour and they will need to come out with something special here.Right, were ready for the start.

India, on the other hand, have picked two fast bowlers and two spinners.Kumble says its a great feeling and an honour to captain India. He would have batted first too but hes OK with giving his fast bowlers use of the early-morning conditions. He says the pitch looks a little different from the one he took ten wickets on in 1999 but is fairly confident that it will turn later in the match.India have left out Murali Kartik, Ishant Sharma and Yuvraj Singh, which means VVS Laxman will bat at No 6 and Munaf Patel will share the new ball.Heres the Indian XI.

He says it looks pretty different from the usual Eden Gardens track. But he reckons that there would be, as always, there would be something for the seamers early on the first day.

Its a bright, sunny day up in the hills, and the teams are out on the field warming up for what promises to be a fascinating and hard-fought contest.Play is scheduled to get underway in just over an hours time, but theres some team news just in from the England camp. Ravi Bopara will make his Test debut at No. 6, having edged out the claims of his rival, Owais Shah. Further down the card, James Anderson has been picked ahead of Steve Harmison, whose suspect fitness was reckoned to be too much of a risk for such a crunch contest.England 1 Alastair Cook, 2 Michael Vaughan (capt), 3 Ian Bell, 4 Kevin Pietersen, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Matt Prior (wk), 8 Ryan Sidebottom, 9 Matthew Hoggard, 10 James Anderson, 11 Monty Panesar.9.30am Sri Lanka had an overnight decision to make - the extra pace of Dilhara Fernando or the extra spinner in Malinga Bandara. Theyve gone for Fernando.10.05am Sri Lanka have won the toss - Michael Vaughan calls  incorrectly - and will bat. It looks a pretty good wicket and pretty dry ... its an easy decision, beams Mahela Jayawardene.  Wed have loved to have had a bat, admits Vaughan, but its not over by a long shot.

Ian Botham reports its dry with a few little cracks which will open up as the game progresses. It will get harder to bat on and the bounce will get more uneven as the match goes on.10.25am Out come the umpires, followed by England who go into the now customary huddle, and lastly the batsmen to muted applause.

If youve tuned in thinking that play will get started on time then alas, Ive got news for you... the start has been delayed by two hours following an afternoon shower yesterday which left the pitch pretty boggy Im afraid.Speaking of boggy, Im just watching Rod Boggy Marsh on a repeat of Australias tour of England in 1985, this match in fact .

Anyway, its Sidebtoom to start, over the wicket with three slips, a gully, short leg.I am a friend of Paul Campton (12.30pm comment) and I think he may have overstated his beer consumption capabilities (two pints of Pimms mid-game usually does the trick). With friends like Tim Part, Paul Campton certainly doesnt need enemies.OK, play really isnt very far away now, hearteningly. The England players are just getting a few last-minute warm-ups in.1.00pm Some good news now, play is expected to start in 20 minutes. Martin writes in from Germany about Jim Taylors Ferrari comparison. Is Jim suggesting that cricket is a luxury product only available to the few who can afford it? Is this the direction we want Test cricket to go? If so, it will die out in a few years while IPL flourishes.12.45pm The non-bleating Jim Taylor writes in. I really wish people wouldnt bleat on about ticket prices, its economics plain and simple.  If Lords couldnt sell tickets at £65, theyd have to put the prices down, so what youre really complaining about is the fact that people are willing to pay that much.  This is one of only a few matches a year where they can make a decent amount of money, so why should they have to cater for a family of four?  Perhaps Ferrari should also reduce their prices so we can all have one.John Manison, a Warwickshire fan, writes in on something entirely random for which we salute him. Thought Id let everyone know what a nice guy Asif Din is, he once bought me and my mate an icecream when we were Junior Bears about 17 years ago. A 99 flake with hundreds and thousands if my memory serves me correctly.12.35pm Heres our colleague over at the Guardian, Stephen Moss. The price of tickets is an outrage - as Mike Selvey said recently, for a family of four it would cost £250 before youd even thought about food, transport, etc. Lords will no doubt be full of merchant bankers, MCC members and people on corporate beanos. The first Test I saw at Lords was against the Aussies in 1975. I went on the off-chance of getting a ticket, paid about £1.50 for a field ticket and sat on the field - those were the days - in front of the tavern. In a thrilling morning session Snow reduced the Aussies to 81 for 7 before a remarkable (and, it has to be said, rather anti-climactic rearguard). Sixty quid to watch New Zealand on a damp day at Lords in a re-run of a series we have just played. I loathe the IPL, but with this on offer as the alternative I fear the battle for proper cricket and for cultivating a new audience for the real game may already be lost.12.30pm  This from Andrew. The Wisden Cricketers diminutive sniffer, Daniel Brigham, reports that the Lords lift was especially slow in bringing him up to his full height. Because it was held up by Beefy and Lamby, arguing about where to have their tapas tonight.Paul Campton emails in. I think a days entertainment at £65 is rather a bargain. I suggest that the only problem is that the ticket is normally rather a small part of the cost of a day at the cricket. My beer is normally a slightly larger proportion of the cost.12.15pm  And after all that... I hate to tell you this, but its raining again and an early lunch will be taken. The break will officially commence at 12.30pm.11.55am BST England have won the toss and Michael Vaughan has sent New Zealand in, with the aim of using any swing thats around, while the pitch looks quite green and juicy. We will try to get early wickets and get them under pressure, says Vaughan. The team are excited, the preparations have been good, were looking forward to a good performance.Tim Southee is in the side for New Zealand. We know if we get him onsong, hes a matchwinner, says his captain Daniel Vettori, who is back from his finger injury. We just want to get out and enjoy the experience. Its just a fantastic ground. Our group of guys are excited and cant wait to get out there.New Zealand have a new opening partnership in Aaron Redmond and Jamie How - Redmond having impressed in the warm-up matches over here recently - while Brendon McCullum has been pushed up the order.

Lunch will now be at 1.30, by the way.11.45am BST The umpires are now out there, discussing with the groundsman Mick Hunt, whos wearing trousers today rather than his preferred shorts, so that tells you something about the weather. The rains holding off for now so hopefully the toss will happen soon.11.40am BST No news on New Zealands team yet, that will be named at the toss which we hope wont be long. England are going through some bendy squats at the moment, which sounds a bit like a small place on this sceptred isle, the village of Bendy Squats. The New Zealand players also have long sleeves on and/or woolens on to go through their paces which is important. Theres a touch of nip in the air.Meanwhile, the surnameless Julian has a question. Tickets still available and priced at £65. I wonder if these two statements are somehow related?11.30am BST Andrew Miller is speaking our language. Players are coming out to warm up, and the covers are coming off the square. We like the sound of that, indeed. The Lords hovercover is a jolly clever beast. Blowing lots of air underneath the tarpaulin to flap away the last of the moisture. Genius.11.25am BST There will be another inspection in 20 minutes. However, while the rain may have ceased, it all remains rather gloomy alas, alack. Some work out on the covers to sweep away the standing water meantime. Anything crickety you want to get off your chest, do send us your thoughts here.11.20am BST Some encouraging movements from the middle, where umpires Steve Bucknor and Simon Taufel are consulting. It looks like the rain has stopped, notes Will, and there are tentative steps by the groundsmen, with brooms and brushes, to mop up. Were still some way from play starting, however magical Lords famous drainage system is. It is pretty sharp you have to say, remember how the deluge in the West Indies Test was absorbed in a jiffy.11.10am BST The covers are still on, and on the England players trousers we understand. You may have heard about the issue with official kit supplier adidas and the players individual sponsors. England will be wearing non-branded trousers for todays game, but they will all be the same and they will look like a team, said a spokesman. Anyway, the amicable solution for now is to wear the adidas trousers but with no branding. Weather-wise, Rihannas Umbrella tune is echoing round my head, hope thats not going to be the summer anthem (again!). Does anyone else feel slightly cheated that the weather has been so good but now, come the first day of the Test summer, rain.10.50am BST Tickets are still available for today, by the way, priced at £65 & £60 for adults and £20 for Under-16s from the North Gate Sales Point in Wellington Place.

A word of warning, though, its just slightly too late to be in contention for the England-New Zealand first Test, though you will be able to score points from the second match. But theres plenty of time to get your brains whirring ahead of the West Indies-Australia series. Its all going on (well, except for cricket-wise; still no news on the start of play.)10.10am BST Good morning everyone and welcome to coverage of the first Test between England and New Zealand at Lords. Sadly the weather forecast is correct so far - its raining. The covers are on and no news about the start of play, but its still drizzling so very unlikely well be starting on time, says Will Luke. Very grey, very damp. Gloomy.Matthew Hoggard may be feeling a bit that way too after missing out on playing for England. As expected, England named an unchanged eleven for the third match running, while Andrew Flintoffs side strain ruled him out of contention.No news on New Zealands team yet, but well bring you that as soon as we have it. We being myself Jenny Roesler and Brydon Coverdale, whom its my pleasure to introduce on commentary for the first time. You will have read his work elsewhere on the site.Without trying to harp on about the rain (but this is England) if the weathermen have got it right, theres more coming over the next few days.

Peter Fulton misses out because McCullums back is no good, so Gareth Hopkins comes in.Possibly a good thing for England that theyre not bowling first. It appears James Anderson twisted his ankle warming up out on the ground before play. He should be okay, but batting first gives him extra time to make sure its right.10.20am And we have some New Zealand team news, Brendon McCullum has a dodgy back apparently and wont keep, but he will bat at No. 3.

Now we just need a few of the players to stand up after an enforced break, the like of which is seen in social games when theres a lost ball. Nothing social about this game, of course, plenty to play for.10.05am Still a delay for the sightscreen. Its the turn of the other umpire, Aleem Dar, to look a bit miffed, as are the spectators. West Indies team themselve are relaxed, smiling and joking. Australia, by and large, are unamused. If this carries on Ill need more synonyms for unimpressed.10.00am Were set for the start now at an overcast Kensington Oval. A slight adjustment of the sight screen first up for Phil Jaques. Its taking a bit of a while, but Gayle is looking calm and patient as some men in red kick and push the screen. Jaques is less amused and already the Umpire Benson is on the radio. Its escalating here now, quite a pain is had to be said.9.55am The toss news is in. West Indies won the toss and will bowl as they aim to level the series. Chris Gayle is back and Sulieman Benn is in the team too. Australia have been forced into making a change after Stuart MacGill retired after the last Test - and they have included Beau Casson for  his Test debut.9.50am A very good morning everyone (or afternoon or evening) and welcome along to coverage of the third and final Test between West Indies and Australia at Barbados.Australia have already retained the Frank Worrell Trophy but theres plenty of interest in this final match.

Australia have five sessions to bowl West Indies out, or West Indies have the same time to get 475 runs. The draw is probably out of the equation - unless it rains.The pitch has lost a bit of its bounce so Brett Lee and the fast bowlers will have to work hard, but Benn was dangerous and turned the ball sharply, so Casson and Clarke could probably play a big role.12.40pm We were just about ready to go after lunch when the news has come through that Australia have declared, so there will be a slight delay while West Indies get padded up.

Sunny - hot in the sun, in fact - and a few scattered clouds, but nowhere near as dreadful as yesterday where it rained cats, dogs and other small animals.

Morkel is tall and bouncy. Together, they are a formidable pairing, though Ive not seen enough of Morne to comment.Duncan Slater questions Englands focus.

So Michael, what do you know of DP? Not a great deal. Hes had a really good start this season for Notts. I hope he goes well. Hes faced him once in a Twenty20 for Yorkshire, hes seen him bowl on television, and says that Pattinson was preparing to take his kids to Alton Towers today. Poor kids, what a let-down.10.20am So, whats the mood in the press box? Lets ask our man on the spot, Andrew Gnasher McGlashan. Theres a mild state of shock, he reports. It revives memories of some Headingley selections of the past...Mallender, Kabir Ali, Saggers, Mike Smith. The link...none of them had very long Test careers!10.15am Well, knock me down with a feather. What an incredible selection - Pattinson may be averaging 20.86 for the season, but he has never bowled at Headingley in his life, and it is only three months and two days since he bowled his first ball in first-class cricket in England! Hell clearly go and take a five-for now ...But never mind Chris Tremlett and Paul Collingwood, Pattinson has been picked for his ability to swing the ball, so the man who will be most aghast at this selection will be Englands most reliable Yorkshireman of the past five years, Matthew Hoggard. If he feared his Test career was over before today, it is now.After last weeks Azeem Rafiq fiasco, lets hope the ECB have got Pattinsons registration in order ...9.55am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the second Test from Headingley where Andrew McGlashan, our man on the spot, says the weather is very overcast, but dry at the moment. Showers are forecast for later in the day.The big news is that England have dropped Paul Collingwood and left out Chris Tremlett.

Umpires make mistakes and are accused of cheating, Steve Bucknors effigies are being burnt, teams threaten to fly home from a country, boards criticise umpires. Should we have a system where the umpire is given an opportunity to review his own decision and make a final decision himself? That would be preferable.

Please hold your anger and your mails [on that subject]. No point in getting worked up na?Lovely little story involving Bomber Wells. Back in the 40s I played for a couple of years for the Gloucester Nondescripts. The Nondies. We only played away matches. Went out by charabanc. Had a sing-song. Ghost Riders In The Sky, She Wore Red Feathers. All the families used to come. Anyway, we played at Witney one day, and they had this chap Len Hemming who played for Oxfordshire. Wonderful player. Well, I came off my one pace run, and I bowled him. And as he was going off, Bill Hook said to our skipper Jack Stevens, I dont think he was looking when Bomber bowled him. Ill get him to come back. We played all away matches, you see, and we didnt like to offend anyone. So he came back rather sheepishly, and I bowled him next ball as well. And everyone started laughing. Well, Bill turned to Jack Stevens again. But before he could say a word, Len Hemming swung round. If you think Im staying here for him to get his bloody hat-trick, youve got another think coming. And off he went.  More fab stories at  this place.We didnt want to charge him but Sachin insisted, Kumar said. Sachin was not carrying his wallet and Harbhajan Singh paid by credit card on his behalf. By the way, the sardar was highly impressed with the saloon managers moustache, it is learnt.  This is not the first time that Sachin has visited us. I cut his hair some 3-4 years back when he came to play in this country, Samantha added. Anil Kumble also once came to me for his hair cut and dye. International cricketers have visited me.    \nThat reminds me ... need to get a hair cut. My barber too is very happy to have me. Yeah right!Well ... nothing to do but wait. So here is some Cardus for you. On bouncers. One of the most frightening exhibitions of fast bouncing bowling I have ever seen occurred at Old Trafford in 1948 during the England v. Australia Test match. Lindwall was awesome. He almost paralysed Comptons left arm, then, with a no-ball so much over the crease that he let the ball go its vicious way far down the pitch, he struck Comptons forehead as in fact Compton actually tried to hook (no running away!) and the missile flew off the edge of his bat. Compton staggered and was led from the field, his forehead bleeding. Stitches were sewn into the wound. He wanted to resume his innings but was advised by a doctor to rest awhile. Edrich (Bill), held the fort bravely, even as his kinsman did at Sydney the other week.Compton - believe it or not - went to a net to find out if he could still see a quick ball, then resumed his Test match innings, stayed until close of play, and next morning carried his score to 145 not out. As Wisden recorded, Lindwall bowled bouncers with such force and dangerous aim that during this season of 1948 he knocked-out or hurt Compton, Todd, Washbrook (a great hooker), Keeton, Robertson and Watkins.For the Sri Lankan fans out there, have a look at this wonderful piece from Ram Guha on  two Sri Lankan masters.  F.C. (Derek) De Saram and Mahadevan Sathasivan.A few years back I too had written on  Satha. Fascinating character. As fate would have it, both the great Sri Lankan masters spent some time in jail, de Saram for a political coup he was part of and Sathasivam for a murder that he didnt commit. De Saram was a rightist and was involved in a coup to unseat the democratically elected government of SWRD Bandarnaike, spending many years in jail in the 1960s till a legal technicality secured his release. Sathasivam was suspected of murdering his wife with ammi kal, a cylindrical grinding-stone. After a very widely followed trial where Dr Colvin R de Silva, a high-profile attorney, defended his case and proved that it was a servant in the house who was the culprit, Satha was released and carried from the court on the shoulders of his fans.----------------Rain Bad news. Overnight heavy rain which carried on in the morning as well and its still drizzling out there. Its monsoon season in Sri Lanka and the ground staff have come prepared. 90% of the ground is covered. They are regularly removing water from the middle, even with rain around, to stop the water from sweeping in through the covers like a tea bag. So at the moment it is just a drizzle and probably the ground staff will need 90 minutes to clear the covers. Having said that, chances of play starting before lunch looks bleak.Meanwhile, while you wait, why dont you join the   Cricinfo Fantasy Cricket . Go on, do it.

He backed himself in a foreign land, pounded his way into the England side after satisfying the criterion for qualification and now he gets to lead his adopted country out for the toss, ironically, against the country of his birth.This certainly is a historic moment and we can look forward to plenty of chatter over the next few days. KPs opposite number Graeme Smith wont resist having a go. Much fun. If Pietersen captains as aggressively as he bats, then England might just have found the right man.Dead rubbers may have little in entertainment value, but how England perform today should have an important bearing on the Ashes next year. To put a positive spin on things, they have to view this Test as the start of a new era, as if beginning on a new slate. They need to rewind five years ago when they squared the series 2-2 with an astonishing comeback after being hammered on the first day. They can go back a further nine years when Devon Malcolm decimated South Africa with 9 for 57. Ive always wanted to watch that spell.'),

Asad Rauf and Rudi Koerzten are the on-field officials. Play ball!8.55am local Lets have a look at the pitch. It looks hard, a real batting track. Hardly any grass, and there doesnt look to be much in it for the spinners just yet. Bat first, boss!The weather looks good, no sign of rain after it threatened to disrupt this match the day before yesterday.Plenty of emails flooding in questioning whether Australia will pick Jason Krejza or Cameron White as the spinner. Lets find out, as we head over to the toss ...... and Anil Kumble has flipped, Ricky Ponting has won it, and he has no hesitations in deciding to bat on what he calls a good surface. A few whistles go up across the stadium. And Australia have opted for White. So he makes his Test debut. Kumble feels there will be cracks that will open up as the game proceeds. He feels the boys are fired up.Okay, I need coffee. Back in a moment.8.30am local Hello and a very warm welcome to Cricinfos live ball-by-ball coverage of the first cricket series weve seen since the first week of September. Good morning one and all, Jamie Alter here, on commentary after what seems like an eternity. Handling the scoring duties for this Test will be the trusted Binoy George.Hard to believe there has been no international cricket since Australia hosted Bangladesh in Darwin for three one-day internationals - the last game was September 6, to be precise.Anyways, enough of that. This is a much-hyped series we have starting shortly - the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between hosts India and Australia.Mark Nicholas is at the Chinnaswamy Stadium speaking to the two former cricketers after whom the series is named. They are standing around a small table with the trophy in the middle. All suited up. Spiffing, really.The fans have started trickling in. First day of a Test series - a really big one too - and hardly any fans. Disappointing.Have you read S Rajeshs preview yet? Or about the new distractions for India? Or how Ricky Ponting has banked on  new-age fielding? And if you havent made your Fantasy League teams yet, hurry up and do so here! There are goodies to be won, so get on it. I dont have news of the teams yet, but the toss is in about 13 minutes.What I can tell you is that Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke has recovered from a stomach virus and allrounder Shane Watson has been declared fit to play his first Test in three years after suffering a chest infection. Phil Jaques has been omitted from the 12 announced on Wednesday, leaving Simon Katich to partner Matthew Hayden. India have narrowed their 15-man squad to 13, leaving out RP Singh and S Badrinath.Now let me say right off the bat, I will not be able to put up all your emails, but I will do my best to type the ball-by-ball commentary and read as many as I can. Its tough, so bear with me.'),

The Victorian right-arm quick took 33 wickets in five Pura Cup games last season. Growing up in rural Victoria, he won several district woodchopping titles during his teens. Hes had more than his fair share of injury worries already. He has already undergone a couple of shoulder reconstruction operations but he didnt let that abandon his cricketing ambitions. Siddle gets on the saddle. That would be a tabloidish headline. Okay, Ill stop now.Pitch (8.50 am)  Like I said earlier, the suns out and that can only be good for the pitch. According to Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, it appears very hard and has a layer of grass to bind the surface together. He reckons this is a bat first pitch but they will have to give the first hour or so to the bowlers. Expected. Daljit Singh, the curator, wasnt shouting from the roof tops yesterday for the sake of the bowlers.The toss is about 10 minutes away so till that happens, lets get back to Kumble. He said his shoulder felt ok, but wasnt 100% fit yesterday. I see no point in him risking it today if thats the case. Theres plenty of time left before the Delhi Test and dont forget, Delhi is one of his favourite venues. Munaf Patel could be quite a handful with his nagging accuracy. Will he play? Well find out soon.As for Australia, one change is certain. Peter Siddle comes in for the injured Stuart Clark. Hes quicker than Clark and was quite impressive in Hyderabad. I reckon Australia will really miss Clark here.All talk in this match has centered around four things - the pitch, the pitch, the pitch and Anil Kumble. More news on that shortly. Theres still another half an hour for the toss so the excitement will follow.Im just as curious as you are about the pitch. What I can tell you is that the suns out at the PCA Stadium in Mohali. We had rain over the last few days and Daljit Singh, the curator, said there may not be as much bounce on the first day. He described the surface as sluggish. Daljit said sunshine was needed to spruce up the pitch for the seamers and weve made a good start as far as that is concerned.And as I can see, the mails are starting to flood in about the weather. Flood and weather - pun unintended, I can assure you!Now for Kumble. He recently took his anger out on the media for sensationalising and overanalysing every single grey area in his bowling or captaincy. I sympathise with him. Reggie Hartman-Goodin summed up Kumbles predicament here.'),

For starters, have a look at this piece about the familiar burdens that Anil Kumble, almost certain to play today, faces. Then theres  Ali Cook, who feels Australia must turn practice into performance.Regarding team composition, Im sure youve read heard that Harbhajan Singh is in some doubt because of toe injury. Should Harbhajan miss out, Amit Mishra, who took seven wickets in the 320-run win at Mohali, will retain his place. Stuart Clark is fit for Australia, and should replace Peter Siddle.Let me remind all you social network addicts, or anyone thinking of becoming one, that we now have a Cricinfo  page on Facebook.

Ill do my best to read all of them. Nothing senseless or irrelevant please, like why underwater knitting should become an Olympic sport or whether its Younis or Younus Khan.Dangnabbit, lets get to the toss already!Alrighty then, as Stanley Ipkiss alter-ego would say, we can now go down to the middle and get started. The two captains are out in the middle and theyre about to flip the coin. Kumble spins, Ricky Ponting calls tails and its heads, to much cheer from the local supporters, and the captain has no hesitation in batting. And Harbhajan is indeed ruled out with that toe injury, so Mishra gets his second Test. Thats interesting, India fielding two leg spinners. Whens the last time that happened? Actually Kumble and Piyush Chawla played against England at Mohali in 2006, but before that ... this requires some thinking ...For Australia, Clark replaces Siddle, as expected. Ponting wants a better showing from Australia - really?? - and says the side have identified the problems. Weve trained brilliantly, he says.Super stuff. Im kicked. Love first mornings of Test matches. Just let me go get a cup of coffee.The answer to Bradleys question, emails Stephen, may be that the selectors believed that dumping White after one Test would make his initial selection look like a knee-jerk reaction.Greetings from cold cold Cleveland in the US. Its snowing outside on Diwali night, but totally hooked onto the game, says Manan. Ah yes, I forgot about time zones. Get warm, boss, were in for a good days Test cricket. Cleveland, of all places.

Rain marred the first three days, and now Bangladesh are 26 for4, trailing by 236 runs.OK, sitting in Boston, it is midnight, I have had my nap and am ready for an exciting all-nighter.....do you think Indian team can offer us these simple pleasures in life?? asks Rita Gupta. Thats up to you to decide, Rita. Im sure Bostons as cold as Cleveland. Clearly there are plenty of people up at odd hours and logged into watch this Test. I am loving it. Or, as my man McLovin would say, I am McLovin it. Fo shizzle.Loud cheer as the local boys, Sehwag and Gambhir, walk out. Sehwag needs two runs to become the highest run scorer in 2008.

Thats a delay of upto 45 minutes.It looks like England may not see too much grass in India either. Some of those surfaces can be unforgiving for a bowler.

Both sides have included two spinners. Win toss, bat first.Cricket is under a cloud of fear and the MA Chidambaram stadium is now virtually a fortress, what with commandos and top-level security officials everywhere. Is that whats keeping the crowds out? There are hardly any spectators in.As I mentioned in the preview yesterday, England have recalled the wicketkeeper Matt Prior and handed a debut to Graeme Swann, the offspinner. Both Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Kevin Pietersen had plenty to say on the eve of this match.Doubtless, the build-up to this match hasnt been ideal.

An x-ray revealed a crack in the thumb and the expected recovery time is ten days, which would mean hes an unlikely starter for the Boxing Day Test.The fantasy game cut-off is in five minutes (11.15 am) so youd better hurry if you want to make last-minute changes to your fantasy team.No surprises in the Australian line-up.The umpires for the first Test are Aleem Dar and Asoka de Silva. The third umpire is former Australian medium-pacer Paul Reiffel.If you had Prince in your fantasy team, it might be a good time to take him out. Remember the cut off time is 15 minutes prior to the start of the game.This is the big one. The champion v the challenger. Australia are ranked one in the world and wiped out New Zealand 2-0 at home recently (after losing in India). South Africa are No. 2 and they havent been beaten in a Test series since 2006, and they brushed aside Bangladesh at home in the lead-up to this clash. Check out Brydons preview for more details on the build-up.'),
(1900, 1, '11.45am Hello and welcome to our coverage of the 2nd Test match between New Zealand and West Indies at McLean Park in Napier, with Lawrie Colliver and me, Callum Stewart. West Indies have  won the toss and will bat. Forecast is for bit of cloud, at the moment though its bright and sunny and hopefully it will stay that way for the rest of the day. The teams are as follows.New Zealand - Daniel Vettori (c), Jamie How, Tim McIntosh, Daniel Flynn, Ross Taylor, Jesse Ryder, Kyle Mills, Brendon McCullum (wk), James Franklin, Mark Gillespie, Iain OBrien, Jeetan Patel.West Indies - Chris Gayle (c), Sewnarine Chattergoon, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Xavier Marshall, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Brendan Nash, Denesh Ramdin (wk), Sulieman Benn, Jerome Taylor, Daren Powell, Fidel Edwards.11.58am The players are out and limbering up. Looks like Gayle will face the opening delivery from Franklin.'),

(1901, 1, 'Gautam Gambhir will face the first ball and James Anderson will open the attack...heres to five more days of great cricket.Oh dear, already we have issues with the ball and its not even been used yet. The box of new balls comes out and the England players huddle around to pick another one, perhaps the bowlers didnt get a chance to pick the one they wanted because of the hurried start. Anyway, we look just about ready.Anderson has three slips a gully and a deep leg gully.9.50am The pitch looks bare, especially on a spinners length, and theres also a crazy-paving effect. However, theres some grass on a length for the seamers and David Lloyd calls it an interesting pitch.Here come the players, Kevin Pietersen leads out England. Can the new-ball bowlers take advantage of the overhead conditions and stop Virender Sehwag? We shall see.Play will start at 9.50am, so just about eight minutes away.9.35am India have won the toss and have decided to bat. Theres a touch of grass and its overcast, Dhoni said, but if you look at the pitch it should spin later on.Dhoni also confirms Rahul Dravid will remain at No. 3 despite suggestions he would drop down the order. We have to start from scratch in every game but confidence is high.Kevin Pietersen admits he would have batted...he doesnt mince his words, which is always nice.England 1 Andrew Strauss, 2 Alastair Cook, 3 Ian Bell, 4 Kevin Pietersen (capt), Paul Collingwood, 6 Andrew Flintoff, 7 Matt Prior (wk), 8 Stuart Broad, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 James Anderson, 11 Monty Panesar9.30am The toss will take place in a few minutes with play due to start at 10am, which is great news.Meanwhile, Stuart Broad has just been interviewed and revealed England are playing well in the nets - well, isnt that just jolly fine. If cricket matches were played in the nets, this England team would be No. 1.9.25am Owais Shah not picked is beyond my comprehension, says Kirshan from Singapore. He has indeed been very unlucky, and the pressure will be on Ian Bell over the next five days. Rauf and Harper have just said the light reading is around six and theyd like it to be up at seven before play can start. Not really sure what those readings mean, but its clearly very dull. Another point to remember, the floodlights cant be used because of a pre-series arrangement between the teams. Doesnt seem to make sense, but nothing new there.9.20am The two umpires for this match, Daryl Harper and Asad Rauf (who now has his visa), have had the light metres out but arent too happy at the moment. Its a chilly, gloomy morning, quite English, and the England players are wearing long-sleeve tops as they warm up.9.15am There will be a delayed start this morning due to bad light and there hasnt been a toss yet. Hang in there, hopefully it wont be too long. Play this match so far north is a risk and we are likely to have reduced days throughout the game. Both sides will have to factor that in to how they play. If you want to keep yourself amused as we wait for the action, try the Cricinfo Quiz.9.05am As is likely to be the pattern throughout this match, the umpires are having an early look at the light. Its an overcast morning, typical of northern India at this time of the year (that isnt my local knowledge, thanks to Kanishkaa for that info).Some team news for you, Stuart Broad comes back for England and replaces Steve Harmison. Broad missed the first Test with a hamstring injury he picked up during the one-day series. Monty Panesar and Ian Bell both hang onto their places, so no chance for the unlucky Owais Shah.8.55am Hello and welcome to Cricinfos coverage of the second Test between India and England in Mohali. This match will have to go some to match the first Test for drama, but its a new day for both teams and everyone starts afresh.Im Andrew McGlashan and am looking forward to bringing you the action over the next five days, along with some help from Martin Williamson. Stay with us for all the team and toss news in the next few minutes.'),
(1901, 2, 'Out come Englands openers and theres even some shadows on the pitch as the sun begins to burn through. Zaheer Khan will open the bowling...10.25am Just a few minutes away from the start now with Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss facing a tough hour before lunch. Strauss was outstanding in Chennai but now has to start all over again. Cook, meanwhile, needs a big score. He hasnt made a Test century this year and has got into the habit of making 50s and 60s then giving his innings away.10.20am The pitch still looks good, but it will be interesting to see whether the dew has an impact on what happens. David Lloyd does kneels on the pitch to see if theres any moisture on the surface, and after finding his trousers are still dry declares its fine and it should be a batting day. However, the cloud cover may help the quick bowlers.10.00am Good news folks, play will start at 10.30am (05.00GMT) as the fog continues to clear the ground. So, I think that means an hour of cricket before lunch. Will confirm details with you as soon as I get information.9.45am Nothing much to add from the ground at the moment as we wait for the fog to clear. Meanwhile, South Africa are 312 for 4 chasing 414 in Perth - what a Test that is - and New Zealand are 367 for 8 against West Indies in Napier.Heres something to pass the time, the Cricinfo Quiz. Its a cracker.9.25am Still fairly misty outside, but the Indian players are warming up. They are all wrapped up in hats and long sleeves, its another chilly winter morning. We could do we some breeze picking up to blow this fog away.9.15am If India takes a 150+ lead, there are chances for a win. Indias scoring rate was a problem, says Pramod. If it was over 3, it could have been a better match. Lets wait and see, 453 is a good total and England have a lot of work to do. The value of Indias approach was shown by their later collapse yesterday afternoon.From the ground, the fog continues to lift and its getting brighter by the minute. No official word yet, but we should hear something soon.9.05am England need as much play as possible in this match, but from Indias point of view they wont want to bowl with a damp ball and theres a lot of dew on the outfield at the moment. The good news, though, is the fog is lifting and theres a feeling that once it clears we shouldnt be too far away from a start.8.55am Well, Ive just seen the ground or, more accurately, I havent because it is covering in fog. David Lloyd is trying to explain conditions and you can hardly see him!Once the action starts, head over to Cricinfo 3D to see replays of every ball.8.50am Good morning everyone and welcome to day three from Mohali. Im Andrew McGlashan and will bring you the action this morning. India are in a strong position, having made 453 which is a good total on this pitch. Now its over to their attack to see how much swing and spin they can find. For England, it will be a long day of tough batting as they try to form a platform to match Indias total. They bowled with great heart yesterday afternoon, but can they transfer it to a batting performance. We shall see over the next eight hours. It should be fascinating viewing.Early news on conditions out there is that its a very misty morning and we dont have a confirmed start time as yet. Well have our inspection as soon as we can see the centre, jokes the umpire Daryl Harper.Meanwhile, users can grab our various RSS feeds which means you can keep up with all the latest news. We have feeds for each Test team, live scores, and for various featured content on our site.4.30pm Ah, well, that was all a little pointless. The light has been offered and everyone is trooping off straight after trooping on. So the England openers avoid having an awkward session to face, meaning Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss can start afresh tomorrow.India are well placed to press home their advantage in the morning, the pitch is starting to spin while Zaheer Khan will search for reverse swing. It will be a major test for Englands batsmen because they need to play positively to try and match Indias total. Could be the perfect stage for KP, but we shall see. Play will start at 9.00am tomorrow (03.30GMT) and well be here to bring you all the action. But for today, from Andrew McGlashan, Martin Williamson and Andrew Miller, its goodbye and thanks for joining us.Here come the India players, and straight away the umpires have a look at the light.

Three slips and a gulyl for him. Ntini, Steyn and Morkel just had a group huddle, looks like they were trying to pump themselves up for a big new-ball session, says Brydon.Ive got those talking Boonie and Beefy dolls from the 2006-07 Ashes on my desk and Boony is piping up. Ho,ho ho, its father Boonie, he chirps in Christmas spirit. Boonie army, boonie army. Hes as up for todays contest as a doll can be! If they made a South African doll, I wonder who itd be. Andre Nel?If youre the sort who likes cricket news to be delivered to you, it might be a good idea to check out the Cricinfo Daily.Hauritz will do a good job with that holding role where you can rotate the fast bowlers at the other end. I like Krejzas line but he needs to learn a bit more about the defensive side of his game.So Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich will head out to the middle in about 30 minutes. To say Hayden is under a bit of pressure would be understating it. Hes said he would consider his future at the end of the series.Youve got about five minutes to make changes to your Fantasy teams (if you havent already!). If youre wondering whether to sub out Hayden, you might want to read this first.There are a few clouds around but a good warm day in Melbourne, the forecast 27 degrees.Both teams had named their XIs on Christmas Day. Australia made only one change, replacing the offspinner Jason Krejza with Nathan Hauritz. Peter Siddle retained his spot ahead of Ben Hilfenhaus. There was some concern over Andrew Symonds knee but it evidently wasnt serious enough to warrant a replacement.South Africa havent made any changes to the team that pulled off the  run-chase in Perth. Why would they?'),

The momentum is with Australia, who scored 114 runs in the morning after South Africa got stuck into the lower order at the start of the day.A news update for those who havent heard - Vaughn van Jaarsveld will join South Africas Test squad on Sunday to cover for ongoing injuries to Ashwell Prince and Graeme Smith. Prince suffered a cracked thumb prior to the Perth Test and JP Duminy was promoted to the starting line-up, leaving no backup batsman in the touring party. Smith has been battling an elbow problem that needed a painkilling injection before the Melbourne Test.For now, though, Smith will open the innings with Neil McKenzie. Brett Lee has the ball, and three slips too.'),

Theres a lot of attention on Haydens form as well, and he would have been expecting to bat with a sizable lead this morning. Now he has a deficit to wipe out. Katich has been in form though. About ten minutes of play remaining in the day, enough for two overs, three tops.Dale Steyn will open the bowling, from round the wicket. Three slips and a gully.'),
(1902, 4, 'Welcome back, the players are out and we have approximately half an hour of play left in the day. Brett Lee has come out to bowl - he is expected to miss the third Test by the way because of an injured foot - and he will take the new ball'),

Lets see this time Well, patience pays due dividends KamalPitch  has a layer of grass on it and prevailing conditions will aid the pace bowlers. The ball will zip away from the surface and will certainly aid the swing bowlers. Mashrafe, Shahadat, Vaas are you listening? Spinners also will have a say on the proceedings as the pitch is expected to deteriorate. Right then, win the toss and bowl first seems to be the mantraJinath from Sri Lanka reminds us that it is four years to the day that tsunami ravaged the country and would like the players to wear black bands in remembaranceRipon asks Bangladesh had missed many chances to win test match against any strong team. However, this time they wont miss any chance. What do you think?  Well, I would like to sit on the fence and watchMike presents his view from the opposite side as he says If Bangladesh win the toss, the best thing for them is to bat first simply because theyll have a better bounce on the ball and keep rolling the first innings hopefully towards Tea on Day 2.  Once they achieve that, who knows? They might be on good shape to have a competitive Day 3 and 4, and weather could also put them in a favourable position - as well as home ground advantage  True to the wordHasitha replies to Tariq saying Murali actually likes a fast and bouncy pitches where he can do wonders with the ball. he can spin the ball on any surface and the bounce will help him. so no problem for us and Arul says Well..Murali would love a pacy/bouncy wicket than a slow turner..hence if Bangladesh has done that, then they would have played into the hands of Murali because remember Sri Lanka has a better pace attack too No wonder, where their allegiances areIsnad is a true blue cricket fan as he says Unfortunately, this kind of foggy weather might be visible every morning during the test match. But I hope that there is going to be good performances from both Bangladeshi and Srilankan players.Tariq says A Bangla newspaper said the pitch was made to have bounce and fast, instead of slow and low, to prevent Murali from becoming dangerous. lets see, how the pitch behave Well, I would like to presume he has been reading The IndependantMeanwhile Ricky Ponting has marched his way to a century in Test at MCG against South Africa and Australia are 184/3 at the momentChris says I take it this fog has came from India, such a shame too, as I was looking forward to this Test Match Well, its winter time in the sub-continent.

They troubled South Africa and New Zealand in this year and could not quite reach the post. Ashraful, would so dearly like to notch up a win hereSri Lanka, on the other hand would like to clear the air regarding them being complacent.

Im Jamie Alter, your commentator for this match, and along with our scorer Venkat Raghav allow me to wish you a very happy New Years.This is a dead rubber Test, what with South Africa having wrapped up the series 2-0 before the end of last year. Lets see what this Test throws up. Plenty to watch, namely how Australias two debutants perform and if Matthew Hayden can get into double figures. Can South Africa make it 3-0 and become the No. 1 side in the world? We will find out in the next five days.Were moments away from the toss. Have you made your Fantasy League teams?And now to the toss, which Ricky Ponting has won and decided to bat. With Brett Lee, Shane Watson and Andrew Symonds injured, Australias is one of their most inexperienced attacks. The Victorian allrounder Andrew McDonald and NSW left-arm seam bowler Doug Bollinger make their debuts.South Africa, who have named an unchanged team, are looking to inflict Australias first home whitewash in 122 years.Well Im excited to see how this Test pans out. Do remember to keep the feedback emails coming. At this point, looking at the absolute disarray in the Aussie ranks, Im predicting a sweep by SA.   They have the better bowling, batting, fielding and attitude . . . at the moment.   This, and the recent victories by India, was needed.   Its going to be very interesting to see if Australia can swing back towards what they once were, says Paul Skillicorn.Theres a little cloud covering but conditions look good for cricket otherwise. The spectators are out in pink for the McGrath foundation. A good crowd at the SCG.Ill have to be honest, I dont know too much about the two Australian debutants, but here are some statistics. McDonald, 27, has made four half-centuries for Victoria and scored 324 runs at an average of 46.28 this summer. He has also taken 15 Sheffield Shield wickets, at an average 23.93.Bollinger, also 27, topped last seasons Pura Cup wicket-takers list with 45 wickets for NSW at an average of 15.44. He first toured West Indies with the Test side last year but did not get a game. Oh, and hes had hair transplanted from Russia, Im led to believe.This is something we dont see very often - two left-arm fast bowlers in an Australian Test side. Chris Matthews and Bruce Reid played together in the 1980s. So yeah, its been a while. Ponting has said this Test is the beginning of an exciting era for Australian cricket.The Aussie selectors are the ones under the pump, Hilditch, Boon, Hughes and co have made a real mess of things this summer, Hayden should have gone and why Hilfenhaus has been overlooked again is beyond me1 Mcdonald is a handy Shield player at best and will be exposed at Test level, the search for a Flintoff type all rounder has come to a dead end! says Gary Irons.If youre the sort who likes cricket news to be delivered to you, check out the Cricinfo Daily.Lets head down to the middle, where Hayden and Simon Katich are taking their places. Dale Steyn has the new ball for South Africa. Plenty of cheer from the SCG as the teams come out.

Its got something for the bowlers, certainly, and there are plenty of clouds above. Breezy, changeable conditions. But with England batting first mere days after being bowled out for 51, the first session really is going to be enthralling (and nerve-wracking for England fans) viewing.The marvellously named Clyde Johnston emails us with a point of pedantry.

Good morning from the Sir Vivian Richards Beach (sorry, Stadium). Its a bright day, but a few clouds are around. There have been showers in the days leading up to this Test. England are beginning their warm-up routine as we await news of their team while West Indies are doing their fielding drills. There has been plenty of talk about the outfield and certain parts are very sandy. But both teams have said they will just have to get on with it.

They have been arriving in Antigua by the boat and plane load in recent days.9.20am Hello everyone, and a thoroughly warm welcome to you all, wherever you might be. Will Luke here, shortly to be joined by Andrew Miller, and were both unsurprisingly up for this contest. I use that word contest in the broadest sense of the term for obvious reasons.

Ryan Sidebottom, meanwhile, could be back in favour as well, as Steve Harmisons stop-start year threatens to shudder to another halt. Thats utterly unofficial, incidentally.
